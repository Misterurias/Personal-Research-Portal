Our assumption is that although the use of AI-assisted \ntools will increase productivity, at the same time, they might lead to the poor quality and insecure software \ndevelopment, which will need to be dealt with through proper industrial adoption strategies. \nResearch has contributed in three ways. To start with, the paper provided empirical evidence that through \nthe use of assistance from AI in code production, there was a significant impact on the software quality \nmetrics namely, cyclomatic complexity, maintainability index and code smell density. Next, the authors \nperformed a comprehensive examination of the security vulnerabilities related to AI-generated code in the \nvarious programming languages and projects. Finally, the research gives the software organizations that \nwant to use AI tools good insights and practices for risk reduction. Thus, the implications of our results \nare very important for the education of software engineers, the industry's practices and the direction of \nfuture research in the area of AI and software development. \n \n2. Literature Review \nThe areas where artificial intelligence and software engineering meet have become the center of a huge \nnumber of research studies, with code generation and program synthesis being the two main areas. The \nfirst automated code generation attempts relied on template-based methods and rule-based systems \nproducing the so-called boilerplate codes from high-level specifications [10]. The deep learning era totally \nchanged the picture, with the application of sequence-to-sequence models and recurrent neural networks \nto the code synthesis tasks [11]. The introduction of the transformer architectures was the turning point, \nwith models such as CodeBERT and GraphCodeBERT being able to perform on a par with the best \nmethods in the problem categories of code understanding and generation [12, 13]. \nRecently, the development of large language models has further changed the scenery in code generation. \nFor instance, GPT-3 showed outstanding learning ability through a few examples for programming tasks \nInternational Journal for Multidisciplinary Research (IJFMR) \n \nE-ISSN: 2582-2160   \u25cf   Website: www.ijfmr.com       \u25cf   Email: editor@ijfmr.com \n \nIJFMR250661350 \nVolume 7, Issue 6, November-December 2025 \n3\n \n[14], while Codex, the engine behind GitHub Copilot, scored highly in competitive programming \nproblems [15]. The following studies have looked into the models' capabilities in various programming \nlanguages and difficult algorithms [16, 17]. \nThe findings of empirical studies of AI-assisted coding tools presented a somewhat mixed picture. Ziegler \net al. indicated that developers using GitHub Copilot completed assignments on average 55.8% more \nquickly and reported higher satisfaction [18]. In contrast, Sandoval et al. indicated that code assemblages \nby AI showed significantly higher vulnerabilities, especially to the integrity of verification of input and \ncryptographic processes [19]. Perry et al. raised concerns about issues of misunderstanding in cloning \nobfuscated code in libraries; licensing problems in open-source projects; and the potential for unnoticed \nsubtle logical problems in open-source projects [20]. \nThe issue of how to assess and ensure the quality of AI-generated code remains an open question in \nresearch.

With the significant breakthroughs of deep learning technologies such as large language \nmodels (LLMs) in the field of code analysis, AI has evolved from an auxiliary tool to a key technology \nthat deeply participates in code optimization and resolving performance issues. As modern software \nsystem architectures become increasingly complex, the requirements for their performance have \nalso become more stringent. During the coding stage, developers find it difficult to effectively identify \nand resolve potential performance issues using traditional methods. This review focuses on the \napplication of artificial intelligence in two key areas: AI-assisted intelligent code generation and AI-\npovered code review. The review systematically analyzed the application of LLMs in software \ndevelopment, revealing a situation where efficiency gains coexist with quality challenges. In terms \nof code generation, models such as Code Llama and Copilot have significantly accelerated the \ndevelopment process. In the field of code review, AI can effectively handle code standards and low-\nseverity defects. However, in the future, this field still needs to address the issues of the reliability \nand security of the code generated by LLMs, as well as the insufficient explainability of the results of \nautomated performance analysis. The future research focus in this field lies in addressing issues \nsuch as the lack of interpretability and insufficient domain knowledge of LLMs. It is necessary to \nprioritize enhancing the reliability of AI recommendations and promoting the transformation of AI \nfrom an auxiliary tool to an intelligent Agent with self-repair capabilities, in order to achieve a truly \nefficient and secure human-machine collaboration paradigm. This article systematically reviews the \nrelevant progress, aiming to promote the transformation of software engineering from an artificial-\ndriven model to an AI-enhanced automated paradigm. It provides theoretical references for ensuring \nthe quality of backend code, improving product delivery speed, and enhancing system reliability. \nKeywords: AI; LLM; Code Generation; Code Review. \n1. Introduction \nRecently, the growing complexity of modern software applications has driven an increased \nemphasis on high-quality, maintainable source code, thereby heightening the difficulty for developers \nto write efficient and error-free code [1-3]. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a smarter approach \nto empover developers. The emergence of Artificial Intelligence has fundamentally transformed \nconventional approaches to code optimization and refactoring by introducing a new dimension of \nautomation [2]. A striking example is LLMs, which have exhibited remarkable potential in \nprogramming tasks [4], especially in code review [5] and code generation [6]. This review aims to \nsystematically review and analyze the current application status and research progress of AI in \nsoftware program development and code generation and review. The analysis focuses on two aspects: \none is AI-assisted intelligent code generation, and the other is AI-powered code review. Through in-\ndepth exploration of these cutting-edge studies, the value of this review lies in clarifying how AI can \nassist developers in performing more convenient programming tasks and enabling the early detection \nof program defects as well as the control of the root causes of performance issues. This not only \nsignificantly enhances the efficiency and code delivery speed of the development team, but more \nimportantly, it greatly improves the reliability and quality of"

We also demonstrate \nthat some dimensions of code quality are improved with AI-assisted code generation tools (i.e., \nmaintainability, cyclomatic complexity) but caution is warranted with operational risks, to code itself (i.e. \nextra code duplication) and security vulnerabilities. We also examined differences across programming \nlanguages, and in particular, we found that while using AI-assisted code generation technologies is \nconstructive in Python, it warrants heightened caution around codex in C++ (to name only one). Finally, \nwhile we examined experience differences, we found that junior developers require support to prevent \nexcessive dependency on AI and senior developers could receive the maximum benefit from an AI tool \nwhen used independently. The security findings are quite concerning, which suggests that the injection of \nvulnerabilities is potentially higher and the chances of being detected is lowered, thus introducing grave \nrisks for organizations. \nSoftware organizations need to introduce processes for security review, advanced training, and the use of \nautomated security analysis in order to recognize possible patterns related to AI-generated code. It is no \nlonger possible to assume AI-generated code is unsafe or that the software development processes you \nhave in place will contain the risks associated with using AI-generated code based on the evidence we \npresent. AI-generated code is a fundamentally transformative and irreversibly changing practice in the \nsoftware engineering of the discipline and the question is how we can achieve the benefit and reduce risk \nthrough additional empirical research and the introduction of specific practices for AI security while \ncontinuing to have experts who are humans. Our research offers organizations an evidence-based basis for \nthe implementation of the AI tool and provides a benchmark for future longitudinal research design of \nlong-term outcomes of the analysis of the argued effort of transformational technology for deployment. \n \n7.
