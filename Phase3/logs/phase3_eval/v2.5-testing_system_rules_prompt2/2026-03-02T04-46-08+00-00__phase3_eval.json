The treated group had an average completion time of 71.17 minutes, while the control group had an average completion time of 160.89 minutes.\n3.

How do different programming languages affect the outcomes of using AI-assisted code generation tools?\n\nThe study by Allamanis et al.

What are some of the potential strategies used by developers when working with AI-assisted code generation tools?\n\nAccording to the study by Sarkar et al.

This suggests that spending more time manually typing may not yield better conceptual understanding. (Evidence Chunk 6.1)\n* The way participants encountered and resolved errors was notably different between the treatment and control conditions. In general, most participants ran the code for the first time after trying to complete most of the question and ran the code again only after the changes were made. (Evidence Chunk 6.2)\n\n**RQ2: How does using AI assistance affect the development of these new skills?**\n\n* Only a subset of AI-assisted interactions yielded productivity improvements. For example, some participants only asked AI assistant clarification questions and demonstrated high proficiency. (Evidence Chunk 11)\n* There was no notable difference in skill formation between groups that used the AI assistant and those that did not. This suggests that AI assistance may not provide a shortcut to enhance both immediate productivity and longer-term skill development. (Evidence Chunk 6.1)",

AI does not merely increase the volume of contributions; it changes the composition of incoming code in ways that intensify technical debt accumulation (A key contribution of our study).\n4. Realized remediation effort, measured through PR rework, is an important outcome of AI-assisted programming and can be used to operationalize technical debt at its point of entry (Our findings also raise concerns about the learning implications of AI-assisted development).\n\nThese conclusions are based solely on the provided evidence chunks and do not represent a comprehensive understanding of the topic.",
