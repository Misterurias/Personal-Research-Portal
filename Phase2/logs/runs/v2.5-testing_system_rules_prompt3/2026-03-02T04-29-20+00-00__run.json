  "answer": "How do AI coding tools affect perceived productivity compared to objective performance metrics?\n\nThe impact of AI coding tools on developer productivity is a complex topic with mixed results. Some studies suggest that the use of AI-assisted code generation tools can lead to increased productivity, as developers are able to complete tasks more quickly and efficiently (Ziegler et al., [61, 62]). For example, a study by Imai ([23]) found that developers who used GitHub Copilot reported higher levels of perceived productivity. However, other studies have found no significant difference in productivity between AI-assisted coding and traditional coding methods (Peng et al., [37]; Vaithilingam et al., [45]).\n\nThe perceived productivity of developers may also be influenced by their individual experiences and attitudes towards the use of AI-assisted code generation tools. For example, a study by Hindle et al. ([9]) found that developers who were more experienced and proficient in using AI-assisted code generation tools reported higher levels of perceived productivity.\n\nOverall, while there is evidence to suggest that AI coding tools can improve developer productivity, the impact may be dependent on various factors, including the specific tool used, the individual experience of the developer, and the context in which they are working.",

[34]\nconsiders “when software developers perceive themselves to be productive and... unproductive” [34, p.1] as an important\naspect of productivity.\nCheng et al. [11] outline a number of subjective and objective factors that impact developer productivity, including\ncode quality, technical debt, infrastructure tools and support, team communication, and organizational changes and\nprocesses. In addition, researchers have found correlations between subjective and objective productivity metrics, such\nas the acceptance rate of suggested code [62] and the number of source code files owned by a developer [40] being\ncorrelated with perceived productivity.\nThe comprehensive landscape of software engineering productivity is captured by the SPACE framework [17], which\noutlines both objective and subjective metrics across individuals, teams, and organizations. In this paper, we focus on\nattitudinal and human-centered measures of productivity such as self-efficacy [44] and the impact of AI on the work\nprocess [53].\n2.3\nImpact of LLM-based assistants on developer productivity\nMany studies have been conducted to examine the impact of LLM-based coding assistants on various aspects of\nproductivity, albeit with mixed results [13, 23, 27, 38, 41, 44, 50, 53, 54, 58, 60–62]. One early study by Weisz et al. [53]\nexamined AI-assisted code translation and found a net benefit to working with AI, though that benefit was not equally\nexperienced by all participants. Kuttal et al. [27] examined human-human and human-AI pair-programming teams but\ndid not find strong differences in outcomes such as productivity, code quality, or self-efficacy.\nZiegler et al. examined the impact of GitHub Copilot on developer productivity [61, 62] and found that developers\nwho used the tool self-reported higher levels of productivity. Contrarily, studies by Imai [23] and GitClear [18] both\nsuggest that the quality of the code produced by GitHub Copilot may be harming productivity due to the number of\nlines that must be changed or deleted.\nAnother consideration for AI code assistants is their impact on the work process. Both Barke et al. [5] and Liang\net al. [28] identified two complementary types of usage of GitHub Copilot: “acceleration mode” in which the tool aided\ndevelopers when they knew what to do next, and “exploration mode” to help developers brainstorm potential solutions\nto coding problems when they were unsure of how to proceed.\n3\nCase Study of an AI Code Assistant\nIBM’s watsonx Code Assistant (WCA) is family of software engineering assistants that supports enterprise-specific\nuse cases including IT automation8 and mainframe application modernization9. In mid-2024, a new variant of WCA,\nknown as “WCA@IBM,” was released internally within IBM and was rapidly adopted by over 12,000 IBM developers.\nThis variant provided general programming assistance in languages including Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, and more.\nIt was implemented as plugins to VSCode and Eclipse, and it supported code generation from natural language, code\nautocompletion, code explanation and documentation, unit test generation, and conversational Q&A.\n8IBM watson"

GitHub Copilot - from here on referred to only as Copilot \n- is one of several GenAIs that can assist developers by \ngenerating, completing and modifying programming code \nbased on the context of the codebase and natural language \nprompts. \nIt \nis \nintegrated \nin \nsoftware \ndevelopment \nenvironments (IDEs) like VS Code and can function as an “AI \npair programmer” for developers.  \nIn recent years, multiple studies have been conducted to \nevaluate Copilot’s output quality and developers’ productivity \ngains through AI usage. Based on benchmark tasks, Dakhel et \nal. [32] found that Copilot can generate solutions for nearly all \ngiven tasks, but its outputs are less often correct than those of \nhumans, making it a potential asset for experienced \ndevelopers but a liability for novices who may not detect non-\noptimal suggestions. So far, there is no consensus on how to \nbest measure software developers’ productivity, but time \nsavings, acceptance rate of Copilot suggestions, and successful \ncompletion of predefined tasks are frequently considered \nmetrics to evaluate developer productivity in the context of \nAI-assisted programming. Empirical studies using these \nmetrics report mixed results: Bakal et al. [1]  found that \ndevelopers using Copilot accepted 33% of suggestions and \nhad a 20% increase in lines of code; Peng et al. [37] observed \nthat programmers completed an HTTP server task 55.8% \nfaster with Copilot, with the largest productivity gains among \nless experienced programmers; while Vaithilingam et al. [45] \nfound no significant improvement in task time or success, \nthough participants still valued Copilot as a useful starting \npoint for daily programming tasks. In this study, we consider \ntask duration, the number of Copilot’s suggestions, and \nsuccessful \ntask \ncompletion \nas \nproductivity \nmetrics. \nAdditionally, we examine the impact of Copilot interaction \ntypes, \ndevelopers’ \ninteraction \nintensity, \nand \nsoftware \ndevelopment task categories on these metrics. This data is \nalso combined with subjective workload ratings from the \ndevelopers to gain a more nuanced analysis of not solely the \noutput quality and productivity gains of Copilot, but also the \ninteraction behavior and experience with Copilot.  \nSeveral studies in the software engineering context have \ndemonstrated benefits of using mixed-methods approaches \nthat combine objective telemetry, physiological measures and \nDevelopers’ Experience with Generative AI \nICSE SEIP 2026, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil \n \n \nsubjective data to provide deeper insights into developers’ \nexperiences during work [6, 17, 36].

This suggests developers may be placing too much trust in AI-generated code, using less \nsecurity judgment in reviewing the AI-generated code compared to their own code, and devolving to a \nless strict and acute heuristic during their security review. \n4.4 Developer Experience and Learning Curve \nThe analysis of patterns of aid tool uptake revealed a learning curve. The experimental group reported \nincreasing productivity improvements across tasks: for Task 1, productivity improved by 18.2%; for Task \n2, it improved by 28.7%; for Task 3, it improved by 36.4%; and for Task 4, it improved by 41.8%, which \nsuggested that the developers were becoming better at using AI in helping them later in the tasks. This \nphenomenon was not as pronounced for the senior developers who showed consistent productivity, \nregardless of task. Experience had a significant impact on the relationship between AI tool use and code \nquality results (F (2,114) =7.43, p=0.001). The junior developers showed larger qualitative improvements \nyet produced a significantly larger proportion of bugs compared to the seniors. While junior developers \naccepted virtually all assistance provided by AI tools (89% of recommendations were accepted, p < .001), \nthe senior developers appeared to the center to weigh their engaging with the AI (62% acceptance of AI \nrecommendations) and could more easily articulate and locate fixes if bugs were identified by the AI tools. \nBoth think-aloud protocol and post-task interviews illuminated three different AI tool use strategies. The \nfirst strategy was the \"prompt-and-accept\" approach (38% of participants), in which participants took the \nAI-generated code suggestion fairly literally and made little modifications. The second strategy, \"iterative \nrefinement\", (47% of participants) used the AI suggestion as a starting point and modified and revised it \nInternational Journal for Multidisciplinary Research (IJFMR) \n \nE-ISSN: 2582-2160   ●   Website: www.ijfmr.com       ●   Email: editor@ijfmr.com \n \nIJFMR250661350 \nVolume 7, Issue 6, November-December 2025 \n8\n \nsignificantly.

Discussion \n5.1 Interpretation of Findings \nThe findings from this research reveal a complicated trade-off landscape in AI-assisted code generation, \nwhich challenges simplistic narrative accounts focused explicitly on productivity. The 31.4% productivity \nincrease is consistent with claims made by practitioners in the field, yet we observe that our results \nhighlight previously under-documented security concerns; further, this demonstrates an inherently basic \ntension associated with our fountain of AI-assisted software engineering: while speed may be enhanced, \nthere are potential security and maintainability trade-offs for future versions of AI-assisted software.

Methodology: A \ncontrolled experiment was performed with 120 professional developers where they were divided into \nexperimental and control groups and 480 code modules were analyzed among Python, Java, JavaScript, \nand C++ projects. Cyclomatic complexity, maintainability index, and code smell density were the three \nparameters for measuring code quality.

Results: The use of AI-assistive tools lead to a 31.4% increase in average developer \nproductivity; however, 23.7% more security vulnerabilities were introduced in the codes generated. Code \nmaintainability went up 18.2%, while cyclomatic complexity decreased by 14.6%.
