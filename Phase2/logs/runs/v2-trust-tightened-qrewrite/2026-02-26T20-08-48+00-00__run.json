  "answer": "What evidence exists about AI coding assistants and collaborative open-source development?\n\nInsufficient evidence in the current corpus.\n\nTo better answer this question, we should search for studies that specifically investigate the impact of AI pair programmers on collaborative open-source software (OSS) development. These studies could provide insights into how AI coding assistants influence developer participation, project-level code contributions, and coordination time. We can also explore studies that examine the effects of AI pair programmers on different types of developers, such as core and peripheral developers.\n\nReferences:\n(None used in this answer)",
