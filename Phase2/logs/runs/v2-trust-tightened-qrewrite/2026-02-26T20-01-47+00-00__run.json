  "answer": "What quantitative evidence exists that AI coding assistants increase task completion speed?\n\nInsufficient evidence in the current corpus.\n\nHowever, based on the provided evidence, it can be noted that while there was a slight improvement in average completion time in the AI group (19.5 minutes vs 23 minutes), this difference was not significant. The study found that the biggest difference in test scores is between the debugging questions, suggesting that using AI for solely generating code without understanding may hinder skill formation.\n\nReferences:\n(SkillFormation2026, SkillFormation2026_chunk_020)\n(SkillFormation2026, SkillFormation2026_chunk_014)\n(SkillFormation2026, SkillFormation2026_chunk_018)\n(SkillFormation2026, SkillFormation2026_chunk_024)\n(SkillFormation2026, SkillFormation2026_chunk_025)",
