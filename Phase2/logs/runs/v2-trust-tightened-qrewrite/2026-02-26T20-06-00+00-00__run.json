  "answer": "How do AI coding tools affect perceived productivity compared to objective performance metrics?\n\nThe study by Ziegler et al. [61, 62] found that developers who used GitHub Copilot self-reported higher levels of productivity. This is consistent with the findings from another study that examined the impact of AI-assisted code generation on developer productivity [EmpiricalToolAnalysis2025_chunk_010 | EmpiricalToolAnalysis2025]. The study found a significant increase in productivity when using AI-generated code, which suggests that AI coding tools can positively impact perceived productivity.\n\nIn terms of objective performance metrics, the study by Kalliamvakou et al. [4] found that usage measurements of developer interactions with GitHub Copilot can predict perceived productivity as reported by developers. This suggests that AI coding tools can also have a positive impact on objective performance metrics such as task time and product quality.\n\nReferences:\n(EnterpriseImpact2024, EnterpriseImpact2024_chunk_004)\n(CopilotCACM2022, CopilotCACM2022_chunk_001)\n(EmpiricalToolAnalysis2025, EmpiricalToolAnalysis2025_chunk_010)",
