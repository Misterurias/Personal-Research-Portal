  "answer": "What risks or limitations of AI-assisted code generation are documented in the corpus?\n\nRisks or limitations of AI-assisted code generation include the potential introduction of security vulnerabilities, particularly in C++ (Sandoval et al., EmpiricalToolAnalysis2025_chunk_001). Additionally, there is a concern about issues of misunderstanding in cloning obfuscated code in libraries; licensing problems in open-source projects; and the potential for unnoticed subtle logical problems in open-source projects (Perry et al., EmpiricalToolAnalysis2025_chunk_001). Furthermore, the research found that AI-assisted code generation tools may lead to poor quality and insecure software development if not properly implemented (EmpiricalToolAnalysis2025, EmpiricalToolAnalysis2025_chunk_003).\n\nThe use of AI-assisted code generation tools was found to introduce 23.7% more security vulnerabilities in the generated codes (EmpiricalToolAnalysis2025). However, it also led to a 31.4% increase in average developer productivity (EmpiricalToolAnalysis2025). Code maintainability went up by 18.2%, while cyclomatic complexity decreased by 14.6% (EmpiricalToolAnalysis2025).\n\nReferences:\nSandoval et al., EmpiricalToolAnalysis2025_chunk_001.\nPerry et al., EmpiricalToolAnalysis2025_chunk_001.\nEmpiricalToolAnalysis2025, EmpiricalToolAnalysis2025_chunk_003.\n\nNote: The provided evidence chunks are from the text you provided.",
