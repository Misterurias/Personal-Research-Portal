  "answer": "Across the corpus, there is no consensus on whether AI coding assistants improve overall developer performance.\n\nThe findings from [EmpiricalToolAnalysis2025] reveal a complicated trade-off landscape in AI-assisted code generation, which challenges simplistic narrative accounts focused explicitly on productivity. While speed may be enhanced, there are potential security and maintainability trade-offs for future versions of AI-assisted software.\n\nSimilarly, [SkillFormation2026] finds no conclusive evidence of a speed up or slow down using AI in the task. The results do not conclusively find a speed up or slow down using AI in this task.\n\nMoreover, [EnterpriseImpact2024] highlights that AI code assistants can have both positive and negative impacts on developer productivity, depending on factors such as code quality, technical debt, infrastructure tools and support, team communication, and organizational changes and processes.\n\nIn conclusion, there is insufficient evidence in the current corpus to draw a consensus on whether AI coding assistants improve overall developer performance.\n\nReferences:\n(EmpiricalToolAnalysis2025, EmpiricalToolAnalysis2025_chunk_010)\n(Copilot: GitHub Copilot)",
