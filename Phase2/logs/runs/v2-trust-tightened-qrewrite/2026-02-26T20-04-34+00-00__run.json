  "answer": "What impact do AI coding assistants have on code quality?\n\nThe provided evidence suggests that AI coding assistants can have both positive and negative impacts on code quality.\n\nAccording to (EmpiricalToolAnalysis2025, EnterpriseImpact2024_chunk_001), the use of AI-assisted code generation tools led to a 31.4% increase in average developer productivity, but it also introduced 23.7% more security vulnerabilities in the generated codes. The study found that Python was the programming language that realized the highest quality improvement (26.3%), while C++ faced the most security risk increase (34.8%).\n\nAnother study (CodeQualityComparison2023_chunk_001) compared the performance of GitHub Copilot, Amazon CodeWhisperer, and ChatGPT in terms of code quality metrics such as Code Validity, Code Correctness, Code Security, Code Reliability, and Code Maintainability. The results showed that the latest versions of these tools generated correct code 65.2%, 46.3%, and 31.1% of the time, respectively.\n\nIn contrast, another study (EnterpriseImpact2024_chunk_001) found that AI assistants powered by large language models can have varying effects on developer productivity and experience. While some developers experienced net productivity increases, others did not.\n\nReferences:\n\n(EnterpriseImpact2024, EnterpriseImpact2024_chunk_023)\n(EmpiricalToolAnalysis2025, EmpiricalToolAnalysis2025_chunk_001)\n(CodeQualityComparison2023, CodeQualityComparison2023_chunk_001)",
