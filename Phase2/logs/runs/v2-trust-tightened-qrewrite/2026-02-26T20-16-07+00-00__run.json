The existing studies primarily focus on the productivity gains of AI tools for software development tasks, but they do not explicitly investigate how different skill levels affect the benefits of AI assistance.\n\nReferences:\n(SkillFormation2026, SkillFormation2026_chunk_002)\n(EmpiricalToolAnalysis2025, EmpiricalToolAnalysis2025_chunk_010)",
