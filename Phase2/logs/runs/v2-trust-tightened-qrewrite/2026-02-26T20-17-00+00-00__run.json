  "answer": "Does the corpus provide evidence that AI coding assistants improve long-term software maintainability?\n\nInsufficient evidence in the current corpus.\n\nTo address this question, additional research and data are needed to investigate how AI coding assistants impact long-term software maintainability. The provided corpus only discusses the effects of AI coding assistants on developer productivity and experience, but does not explicitly explore the impact on software maintainability.\n\nIf you want to add more evidence or references, here are some potential areas to search or include:\n\n* Studies that focus on the relationship between AI-assisted code generation and technical debt\n* Research on the impact of AI coding assistants on code quality, maintainability, and reliability\n* Analysis of the effects of AI coding assistants on software development workflows and processes\n* Investigations into how AI coding assistants influence collaboration and knowledge sharing among developers",
