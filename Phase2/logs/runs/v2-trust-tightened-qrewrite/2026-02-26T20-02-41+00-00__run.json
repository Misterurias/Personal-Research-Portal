In fact, many studies have found improvements in productivity using these AI assistants. For example, Peng et al. (2023) found that crowd-sourced software developers using Copilot completed a task 55.5% faster than the control group, and novice programmers benefited more from AI coding assistance.\n\nReferences:\n(EnterpriseImpact2024, EnterpriseImpact2024_chunk_001)\n(AIProdDecrease2024, AIProdDecrease2024_chunk_006)\n(EnterpriseImpact2024, EnterpriseImpact2024_chunk_004)\n(CopilotCACM2022, CopilotCACM2022_chunk_001)\n(SkillFormation2026, SkillFormation2026_chunk_004)",
