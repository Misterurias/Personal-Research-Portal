A va-\nriety of AI models have demonstrated human-level capabilities in ﬁelds ranging from natural\nlanguage understanding to image recognition [Zhang et al., 2022]. As these systems are de-\nployed in the real-world, how do they change labor productivity? While there is a growing\nliterature studying perceptions of AI tools, how people use them, and their implications for\nsecurity and education [Nguyen and Nadi, 2022, Barke et al., 2022, Finnie-Ansley et al., 2022,\nSandoval et al., 2022] there has been little research on productivity impacts of AI-powered tools\n1\narXiv:2302.06590v1  [cs.SE]  13 Feb 2023\nin professional contexts, cf. [Mozannar et al., 2022, Vaithilingam et al., 2022, Ziegler et al., 2022].\nThe potential productivity impacts of AI have major implications for the labor market and\nﬁrms, including changes in employment, skills, and ﬁrm organization [Raj and Seamans, 2018,\nAgrawal et al., 2019].\nThis paper studies the productivity effects of AI tools on software development. We present\na controlled trial of GitHub Copilot, an AI pair programmer that suggests code and entire func-\ntions in real time based on context. GitHub Copilot is powered by OpenAI’s generative AI\nmodel, Codex [Chen et al., 2021]. In the trial, programmers were tasked and incentivized to\nimplement an HTTP server in JavaScript as quickly as possible. The treated group had access\nto GitHub Copilot and watched a brief video explaining how to use the tool. The control group\ndid not have access to GitHub Copilot but was otherwise unconstrained, i.e., they were free to\nuse internet search and Stack Overﬂow to complete the task.\nThe performance difference between treated and control groups are statistically and practi-\ncally signiﬁcant: the treated group completed the task 55.8% faster (95% conﬁdence interval:\n21-89%).

This suggests developers may be placing too much trust in AI-generated code, using less \nsecurity judgment in reviewing the AI-generated code compared to their own code, and devolving to a \nless strict and acute heuristic during their security review. \n4.4 Developer Experience and Learning Curve \nThe analysis of patterns of aid tool uptake revealed a learning curve. The experimental group reported \nincreasing productivity improvements across tasks: for Task 1, productivity improved by 18.2%; for Task \n2, it improved by 28.7%; for Task 3, it improved by 36.4%; and for Task 4, it improved by 41.8%, which \nsuggested that the developers were becoming better at using AI in helping them later in the tasks. This \nphenomenon was not as pronounced for the senior developers who showed consistent productivity, \nregardless of task. Experience had a significant impact on the relationship between AI tool use and code \nquality results (F (2,114) =7.43, p=0.001). The junior developers showed larger qualitative improvements \nyet produced a significantly larger proportion of bugs compared to the seniors. While junior developers \naccepted virtually all assistance provided by AI tools (89% of recommendations were accepted, p < .001), \nthe senior developers appeared to the center to weigh their engaging with the AI (62% acceptance of AI \nrecommendations) and could more easily articulate and locate fixes if bugs were identified by the AI tools. \nBoth think-aloud protocol and post-task interviews illuminated three different AI tool use strategies. The \nfirst strategy was the \"prompt-and-accept\" approach (38% of participants), in which participants took the \nAI-generated code suggestion fairly literally and made little modifications. The second strategy, \"iterative \nrefinement\", (47% of participants) used the AI suggestion as a starting point and modified and revised it \nInternational Journal for Multidisciplinary Research (IJFMR) \n \nE-ISSN: 2582-2160   ●   Website: www.ijfmr.com       ●   Email: editor@ijfmr.com \n \nIJFMR250661350 \nVolume 7, Issue 6, November-December 2025 \n8\n \nsignificantly. The third strategy was \"validation-oriented\" (15% of participants) to seek reliability and use \nthe AI-generated output as a source of reference when writing code independently. The validation-focused \nstrategy produced mostly high-quality code, but with few productivity gains. \n \n5. Discussion \n5.1 Interpretation of Findings \nThe findings from this research reveal a complicated trade-off landscape in AI-assisted code generation, \nwhich challenges simplistic narrative accounts focused explicitly on productivity. The 31.4% productivity \nincrease is consistent with claims made by practitioners in the field, yet we observe that our results \nhighlight previously under-documented security concerns; further, this demonstrates an inherently basic \ntension associated with our fountain of AI-assisted software engineering: while speed may be enhanced, \nthere are potential security and maintainability trade-offs for future versions of AI-assisted software. The \nparticular performance of particular programming languages might also be providing data interpretations \nthat leave something to be desired: the improved results for Python programming likely derived from the \n"

GitHub Copilot - from here on referred to only as Copilot \n- is one of several GenAIs that can assist developers by \ngenerating, completing and modifying programming code \nbased on the context of the codebase and natural language \nprompts. \nIt \nis \nintegrated \nin \nsoftware \ndevelopment \nenvironments (IDEs) like VS Code and can function as an “AI \npair programmer” for developers.  \nIn recent years, multiple studies have been conducted to \nevaluate Copilot’s output quality and developers’ productivity \ngains through AI usage. Based on benchmark tasks, Dakhel et \nal. [32] found that Copilot can generate solutions for nearly all \ngiven tasks, but its outputs are less often correct than those of \nhumans, making it a potential asset for experienced \ndevelopers but a liability for novices who may not detect non-\noptimal suggestions. So far, there is no consensus on how to \nbest measure software developers’ productivity, but time \nsavings, acceptance rate of Copilot suggestions, and successful \ncompletion of predefined tasks are frequently considered \nmetrics to evaluate developer productivity in the context of \nAI-assisted programming. Empirical studies using these \nmetrics report mixed results: Bakal et al. [1]  found that \ndevelopers using Copilot accepted 33% of suggestions and \nhad a 20% increase in lines of code; Peng et al. [37] observed \nthat programmers completed an HTTP server task 55.8% \nfaster with Copilot, with the largest productivity gains among \nless experienced programmers; while Vaithilingam et al. [45] \nfound no significant improvement in task time or success, \nthough participants still valued Copilot as a useful starting \npoint for daily programming tasks. In this study, we consider \ntask duration, the number of Copilot’s suggestions, and \nsuccessful \ntask \ncompletion \nas \nproductivity \nmetrics. \nAdditionally, we examine the impact of Copilot interaction \ntypes, \ndevelopers’ \ninteraction \nintensity, \nand \nsoftware \ndevelopment task categories on these metrics. This data is \nalso combined with subjective workload ratings from the \ndevelopers to gain a more nuanced analysis of not solely the \noutput quality and productivity gains of Copilot, but also the \ninteraction behavior and experience with Copilot.  \nSeveral studies in the software engineering context have \ndemonstrated benefits of using mixed-methods approaches \nthat combine objective telemetry, physiological measures and \nDevelopers’ Experience with Generative AI \nICSE SEIP 2026, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil \n \n \nsubjective data to provide deeper insights into developers’ \nexperiences during work [6, 17, 36].

Prior studies have focused on how \nindividual skills play a role in shaping the effect of generative AI tools on completing discrete tasks and \nthey found that individuals with lower skills usually obtain greater productivity gain from these tools than \nhighly skilled individuals (e.g., Peng et al. 2023, Cui et al. 2024). Our results draw a sharp contrast with \nthese findings, as we demonstrate that peripheral developers obtain less productivity gain from AI pair \nprogrammers than core developers in OSS settings, potentially because the former do not possess important \nand necessary contextual knowledge about an OSS project to effectively use the AI tools. \n2. Literature Review  \n2.1 Generative AI in Software Development \nA growing body of literature has started to examine the impact of generative AI on software development. \nMost studies have focused on the implications of generative AI for individual productivity on specific tasks. \n 6 \nFor example, Imai (2022) finds that GitHub Copilot produces more lines of code than a human pair \nprogrammer when completing a task in Python. Peng et al. (2023) find that GitHub Copilot enables \nindividual developers to implement an HTTP server 55.8% faster than those not using the tool. Hoffmann \net al. (2024) show that GitHub Copilot causes individual developers to shift focus towards coding tasks and \naway from project management.  \nDespite these insights, research on how generative AI influences project-level outcomes for \ncomplex tasks involving multiple developers remains limited. Yeverechyahu et al. (2024) investigate the \ninnovation capabilities of generative AI, particularly its role in extrapolative versus interpolative thinking, \nand compare its influence on innovation in Python versus R. Different from the existing literature and built \nupon the OSS literature, our hypotheses are motivated by the unique characteristics of OSS, namely, the \nsoftware development process in an open and collaborative environment. Because participation is often \nvoluntary and coordination does not follow formal centralized processes in this environment, it remains \nunclear how generative AI influences open participation in both coding and non-coding activities, as well \nas team coordination, all of which could have important implications for project-level software \ndevelopment productivity. \nIn addition, existing research that explored heterogeneity in the roles of generative AI among \nindividuals has mostly focused on understanding the differential effects between workers with high skills \nagainst those with low skills for discrete tasks (e.g., Cui et al. 2024, Brynjolfsson et al. 2025). However, it \nremains unclear whether the results hold in settings with complex tasks that require not only skills but also \ncontextual knowledge and team collaboration. In the context of OSS development, the distinction between \ncore and peripheral developers lies not in their programming skills, but in their roles, responsibilities, and \nthe resulting level of contextual knowledge about a focal project (Crowston et al. 2006, Setia et al."

For example, AI tools are being used in professional domains such as software development,\neducation, design, and the sciences [Handa et al., 2025].\nProductivity Gains\nMany studies have found improvements in productivity using these AI assistants.\nFor example, Brynjolfsson et al. found that AI-based conversational assistants increased the number of\nissues call center workers were able to resolve on average by 15%.\nDell’Acqua et al. find similar results\nin which consultants completed 12.2% more tasks on average with the help of AI than without it. While\nthe skill-based effects differ across studies, a consistent pattern emerges in call center work, consulting, legal\nquestion-answering, and writing: less experienced and lower-skilled workers tend to benefit most [Brynjolfsson\net al., 2025, Dell’Acqua et al., 2023, Choi and Schwarcz, 2023, Noy and Zhang, 2023]. One exception was\nwhen GPT-4 was given to Kenyan small business owners, AI business advice helped high performers (by\nrevenue) improve business results while worsening the results for lower performers [Otis et al., 2024].\nFor software engineering in particular, Peng et al. found that crowd-sourced software developers using copilot\ncompleted a task 55.5% faster than the control group and novice programmers benefited more from AI coding\nassistance. Follow-up studies of developers in major software companies and found that AI-generated code\ncompletions provide a 26. 8% boost in productivity as measured by pull requests, commits, and software\nproduct builds [Cui et al., 2024]. This study also found that less experienced coders experienced greater\nboosts in productivity. While studies find that junior or less experienced developers experience greater\nproductivity uplift from using AI, these very same workers should be quickly developing new skills in the\nworkplace. Yet the effect of these tools on the skill formation of this subgroup remains unknown. Will the\nskill development of novice workers be affected significantly since they are still in the process of learning their\ntrade? We are motivated by whether this productivity comes from free or at a cost.\nCognitive Offloading\nConcerns around the impact of AI assistance and skill depletion have been highlighted\nby recent works. For example, medical professionals trained with AI assistance might not develop keen visual\nskills to identify certain conditions [Macnamara et al., 2024]. In surveys given to knowledge workers, frequent\nuse of AI has been associated with worse critical thinking abilities and increased cognitive offloading [Gerlich,\n2025]. Furthermore, knowledge workers reported a lower cognitive effort and confidence when using generative\nAI tools [Lee et al., 2025]. However, these surveys are observational and may not capture the causal effects of\nAI usage.\nSkill Retention\nAn adjacent line of inquiry to our research is how well humans retain knowledge and\nskills after AI assistance. Wu et al. find that even when generative AI improved immediate performance on\ncontent creation tasks (e.g., writing a Facebook post, writing a performance review, drafting a welcoming\nemail), the performance increase did not persist in subsequent tasks performed independently by humans\nafterward.
