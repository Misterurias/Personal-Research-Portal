  "answer": "According to the provided evidence chunks, here are some answers:\n\n**1. What is the impact of AI-assisted programming on software maintenance?**\n\nAI-assisted programming amplifies software maintenance challenges, especially for core contributors who bear responsibility for code review and integration. As a result, maintainers are compelled to reallocate their time toward reviewing and managing code submissions instead of writing new code.\n\n**2. How does AI-assisted programming affect the workload distribution in OSS communities?**\n\nAI-assisted programming increases the burden on core contributors, who take on the maintenance-related tasks in the project. This results in a redistribution of effort within OSS communities, with maintainers facing higher review workloads and a concomitant decline in their own development activity.\n\n**3. What is the relationship between AI-assisted programming and technical debt?**\n\nAI-assisted programming introduces code that is difficult to integrate, extend, or refactor, accelerating the accumulation of technical debt. The shortcuts enabled by AI tools may accelerate output while introducing latent liabilities for projects, requiring substantial effort to review, revise, or rewrite code later.\n\n**4. How does AI-assisted programming affect the learning implications in OSS settings?**\n\nAI-assisted development can weaken the feedback loop between contribution and learning, as peripheral contributors may engage less deeply with underlying programming principles and best practices, resulting in code that is functional but brittle.",

As\nwith other AI tools that create superficially polished but potentially shallow results, vibe coding may be\nappealing for rapid prototyping, yet the secondary effects that this may have on reliability or maintainability\nwhen applied to nontrivial software development tasks is an open question.\nOur study investigates this issue by analyzing how the adoption of GitHub Copilot reshapes contributor\neffort across production and maintenance activities, and whether it disproportionately shifts the burden of\nmaintenance onto a smaller group of core contributors.\n2.2.\nConceptualization of Technical Debt\nTechnical debt captures the intertemporal trade-off between short-term development speed and long-term\nsystem maintainability (Cunningham 1992). A growing body of research has established that technical debt\nis economically consequential, persistent, and shaped by organizational choices. Drawing on the informa-\ntion systems and computer science literature, we synthesize prior work in Table 1 and adopt a definition of\ntechnical debt in this study as accumulation of suboptimal code, design, or documentation decisions in PR\nprocess that increase PR Rework (technical debt) and PR Review (maintenance effort) - a definition that is\nparticularly prominent in the era of GenAI software development.\n7 https://stackoverflow.blog/2025/08/07/a-new-worst-coder-has-entered-the-chat-vibe-coding-without-code-knowledge/\n8 https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/curl-will-stop-bug-bounties-program-due-to-avalanche-of-ai-slop\n7\nMeasurement approaches for technical debt have evolved along two complementary axes. One strand\nemphasizes static code metrics (e.g., code complexity, duplication, test coverage) as proxies for debt accu-\nmulation, enabling automated detection and cross-project comparisons (Paramitha and Massacci 2023, Yoo\net al. 2025). Paramitha and Massacci (2023) show how dependency structures in open-source ecosystems\n(top 600 Python packages) amplify technical leverage, allowing localized weaknesses to propagate across\npackages. Yoo et al. (2025) similarly demonstrate that dependency network structures shape the diffusion\nof security vulnerabilities in software supply chains. Another strand operationalizes technical debt through\nprocess and outcome indicators—such as rework rates, defect density, time-to-merge, and maintenance\neffort—thereby connecting debt to developer behavior and organizational performance (Ramasubbu and\nKemerer 2016, Banker et al. 2021, Ramasubbu and Kemerer 2021). Both approaches have value: the former\nmetric-based techniques are scalable and actionable for tooling, while the later process indicators capture\nthe economic and human costs that managers and maintainers ultimately face.\nEmpirical studies across industry and OSS ecosystems consistently find that technical debt impairs long-\nrun productivity and increases maintenance burdens (Paramitha and Massacci 2023). Work in empirical\nsoftware engineering shows that higher measured debt correlates with increased bug rates, longer defect\nresolution times, and reduced velocity for feature delivery (Ramasubbu and Kemerer 2016). Rinta-Kahila\net al. (2023) further demonstrate that organizations can become “trapped”"

This concern echoes evidence\nfrom other AI-augmented work settings, where less-experienced workers experience large productivity\ngains while more skilled workers see modest improvements and increased coordination burdens (Brynjolf-\nsson et al. 2025). In OSS settings, these dynamics can further worsen technical debt by weakening the\nfeedback loop between contribution and learning.\nThese insights point to several directions for future research. Scholars could examine how different\nproject governance mechanisms moderate AI-induced technical debt, such as automated testing, mod-\nular architectures, or formalized review protocols. Future work may also explore heterogeneity across\nproject types, identifying which OSS projects are most vulnerable to debt accumulation under AI-assisted\ndevelopment. More broadly, the dynamics documented here may extend beyond OSS to other knowledge-\nintensive domains where AI increases output without replacing expert judgment. As OSS components are\nincreasingly embedded in enterprise systems and public infrastructure (Nagle 2019), understanding how AI\nreshapes technical debt dynamics becomes critical not only for OSS sustainability but for the resilience of\nthe broader digital ecosystem.\nAs a concluding remark, the challenges observed in OSS, such as quality concerns and increased main-\ntenance burdens driven by productivity gains among newer and less-experienced contributors, should serve\nas an early warning for similar risks in other knowledge-intensive domains where AI is being promoted to\nboost productivity and innovation.\n25\nReferences\nAngrist JD, Pischke JS (2009) Mostly Harmless Econometrics: An Empiricist’s Companion (Princeton University\nPress).\nBanker RD, Liang Y, Ramasubbu N (2021) Technical Debt and Firm Performance.

Work in empirical\nsoftware engineering shows that higher measured debt correlates with increased bug rates, longer defect\nresolution times, and reduced velocity for feature delivery (Ramasubbu and Kemerer 2016). Rinta-Kahila\net al. (2023) further demonstrate that organizations can become “trapped” in technical debt due to coor-\ndination failures, organizational inertia, and escalating switching costs. The introduction of GenAI tools\nsuch as GitHub Copilot represents a departure from these assumptions (Yeverechyahu et al. 2024). Unlike\nprior productivity-enhancing tools, GenAI dramatically lowers the marginal cost of producing code and\nreduces skill barriers to contribution (Peng et al. 2023). While prior studies document productivity gains\nfrom AI-assisted coding, they provide limited insight into how these gains translate into technical debt and\nmaintenance related challenges.\nFrom a technical debt perspective, GenAI may accelerate debt accumulation by increasing code volume\nwithout proportionate improvements in quality, the integration with the software, or architectural coher-\nence (Pimenova et al. 2025). By lowering the cost of producing code, AI-assisted programming encourages\nrapid iteration and experimentation, but can shift attention away from longer-term concerns such as main-\ntainability, readability, and alignment with existing system design (Barrett et al. 2023, Schreiber and Tippe\n2025). As a result, defects, inconsistencies, and design shortcuts may be introduced more quickly than\nthey can be identified and resolved. Over time, this imbalance can compound, transforming short-term pro-\nductivity gains into persistent maintenance obligations that must be absorbed by experienced developers\n(Eghbal 2020). While GenAI promises to enhance development speed and broaden participation, it may\nsimultaneously intensify the very technical debt that constrains system reliability, scalability, and long-run\nperformance (Ramasubbu and Kemerer 2021). If this logic is valid, we expect that GenAI may lead to a\ngreater accumulation of technical debt in OSS projects.\n8\nTable 1\nSelected Literature on Technical Debt and Software Maintenance\nStudy\nContext\nMethod\nMeasurement\nKey Findings\nBanker et al.\n(2021)\nCustomer\nrelationship\nmanagement\n(CRM)\nsystems in 26 firms\nEconometric analysis\nPercentage of customized codes in the\nCRM system that do not adhere to vendor-\nprescribed standard\nHigher technical debt is associated\nwith\nlower\nfirm\nperformance\nand\nreduced operational efficiency over\ntime.\nRamasubbu\n&\nKemerer\n(2021)\nOutsourced Commercial\nOff-The-Shelf\n(COT)\nenterprise systems\nEconometric analysis\nViolations of the design and programming\nstandards established by the vendor of the\nCOTS enterprise system\nActive remediation policies reduce\nlong-term\nmaintenance\ncosts,\nbut\nexcessive deferral leads to escalating\ntechnical debt.\nRamas"

First, the introduction of GitHub Copilot leads to higher\ndevelopment activity at both the repository and individual levels, measured by commits and PR, consistent\nwith industry evidence on AI-driven productivity gains (Peng et al. 2023). Second, these gains are accompa-\nnied by a significant increase in maintenance-related activities, as AI-generated contributions require more\nrevisions before integration - an early indicator of technical debt accumulation. Third, the effects are highly\nheterogeneous: core contributors review more PRs, contribute fewer commits, and extend their mainte-\nnance responsibilities across a wider range of repositories, suggesting that AI-assisted contributions from\nperipheral developers increase coordination and review burdens.\nBy conceptualizing GenAI as an endogenous shock to software production, this study advances the tech-\nnical debt literature in several important ways. First, consistent with prior work linking technical debt to firm\nperformance (Banker et al. 2021) and remediation costs (Ramasubbu and Kemerer 2016, 2021), we demon-\nstrate that AI-assisted code increases realized remediation effort, measured through PR rework. Second, we\nshow that technical debt is increasingly an outdated workload distribution phenomenon: maintenance costs\nare concentrated among a shrinking pool of core contributors, whose own productive output declines as\nmaintenance demands rise. Third, our findings complement research on organizational design and auton-\nomy (Paramitha and Massacci 2023, Yoo et al. 2025) by revealing how technological change can exacerbate\nasymmetries in effort and responsibility, even when the OSS repository workflow remains unchanged.\n15 https://mashable.com/archive/heartbleed-bug-websites-affected\n23\nTo illustrate the scale of Copilot’s impact on OSS communities, Microsoft core contributors in our dataset\nconduct on average, 976 commits, 160 PRs, and 166 PR reviews annually before its introduction. The\nincreased volume of code associated with Copilot adoption results in an additional workload – each core\ncontributor is expected to review approximately 10 more PRs annually. This added maintenance burden\ncorresponds to a reduction of 164 commits and 9 PR contributions per year per core contributor. More\ncritically, GitHub’s 2024 surveys reveal that more than one-third of contributors to the 10 most popular OSS\nprojects made their first contribution after signing up for GitHub Copilot, highlighting a significant influx\nof new and often less experienced developers16.\nWith annual contributions to OSS projects approaching 1 billion, this surge in participation significantly\nincreases the burden on core contributors, who take on the maintenance related tasks in the project. As a\nresult, maintainers are compelled to reallocate their time toward reviewing and managing code submissions\ninstead of writing new code.\n7.2.\nContributions and Future Research\nExtant research on AI pair programming has primarily emphasized productivity and efficiency gains, sug-\ngesting that tools such as GitHub Copilot can substantially accelerate software development (Peng et al.\n2023). While these benefits are evident in our data, our findings reveal a more nuanced set of consequences.\nIn particular, we show that AI-assisted programming also amplifies software maintenance challenges, espe-\ncially for core contributors who bear responsibility for code review and integration.

The shortcuts enabled\nby AI tools may accelerate the output while introducing code that is difficult to integrate, extend, or refactor.\nThe widespread use of AI-assisted pair programming - and, in extreme cases, “vibe coding” - can inject a\nlarger volume of difficult-to-maintain code (Pimenova et al. 2025, Fawzy et al. 2025) into software projects,\naccelerating the accumulation of technical debt. Such contributions create latent liabilities for projects, as\nmaintainers must later invest substantial effort to review, revise, or rewrite code to meet repository stan-\ndards. In this sense, AI does not merely increase the volume of contributions; it changes the composition of\nincoming code in ways that intensify technical debt accumulation.\nA key contribution of our study is to operationalize technical debt at its point of entry. We conceptual-\nize extensive PR rework as realized technical debt: the additional modification, coordination, and revision\n16 https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-2024/\n24\neffort required to bring submitted code up to acceptable standards. This measure complements prior work\nthat captures technical debt through architectural metrics, defect accumulation, or long-run performance\noutcomes. By focusing on PR-level dynamics, we provide a micro-level view of how technical debt emerges\nin real time and how it is managed through ongoing maintenance effort.\nOur findings also raise concerns about the learning implications of AI-assisted development. With AI\nproviding rapid solutions, peripheral contributors may engage less deeply with underlying programming\nprinciples and best practices, resulting in code that is functional but brittle. This concern echoes evidence\nfrom other AI-augmented work settings, where less-experienced workers experience large productivity\ngains while more skilled workers see modest improvements and increased coordination burdens (Brynjolf-\nsson et al. 2025).
