The study (CopilotCACM2022) shows that the acceptance rate is the most immediate indicator of perceived productivity, although it is beneficial to combine with others to get a fuller picture. In contrast, the study (SkillFormation2026) suggests that generative AI tools have been associated with worse critical thinking abilities and increased cognitive offloading, which may negatively impact skill formation.\n\nInsufficient evidence in the current corpus to directly compare these two concepts. However, the studies suggest that generative AI tools may have both positive (short-term productivity gains) and negative (skill formation effects) impacts on developer productivity.",
