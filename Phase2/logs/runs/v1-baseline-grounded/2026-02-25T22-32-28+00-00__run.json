  "answer": "Based on the provided evidence chunks, it can be concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the claim that AI coding assistants are equally beneficial across all developer skill levels.\n\nThe available evidence focuses primarily on the impact of AI assistance on novice workers and junior developers in software engineering, highlighting productivity gains and increased efficiency. However, it does not explicitly address the question of whether AI benefits are consistent across different skill levels.\n\nReferences:\n(SkillFormation2026, SkillFormation2026_chunk_001)\n(SkillFormation2026, SkillFormation2026_chunk_002)\n(SkillFormation2026, SkillFormation2026_chunk_004)\n(SkillFormation2026, SkillFormation2026_chunk_025)",
