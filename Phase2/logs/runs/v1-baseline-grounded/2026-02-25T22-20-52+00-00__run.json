  "answer": "What quantitative evidence exists that AI coding assistants increase task completion speed?\n\nAccording to the provided evidence, there is no conclusive evidence that AI coding assistants significantly increase task completion speed. The study found that while using AI improved the average completion time of the task, the improvement was not significant in their main study (SkillFormation2026_chunk_014). However, they did observe that participants who directly pasted AI-generated code finished the tasks faster than those who manually copied or used a hybrid approach (SkillFormation2026_chunk_020).\n\nReferences:\n(SkillFormation2026, SkillFormation2026_chunk_018)\n(SkillFormation2026, SkillFormation2026_chunk_014)",
