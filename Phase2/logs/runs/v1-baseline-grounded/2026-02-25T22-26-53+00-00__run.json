  "answer": "What evidence exists about AI coding assistants and collaborative open-source development?\n\nThe study \"The Impact of Generative AI on Collaborative Open-Source Software Development: Evidence from GitHub Copilot\" (OpenSourceImpact2024) provides insights into the effects of AI pair programmers, like GitHub Copilot, on project-level code contributions and coordination time in open-source software (OSS) development.\n\nAccording to the study, the use of AI pair programmers increases project-level code contributions by 5.9% (OpenSourceImpact2024_chunk_001). This gain is driven by a 2.1% increase in individual code contributions and a 3.4% rise in developer coding participation. However, these benefits come at a cost as coordination time for code integration increases by 8% due to more code discussions enabled by AI pair programmers (OpenSourceImpact2024_chunk_001).\n\nThe study also finds that the effects of AI pair programmers differ across developer roles. Peripheral developers show relatively smaller gains in project-level code contributions and face a higher increase in coordination time than core developers, likely due to their difference in project familiarity (OpenSourceImpact2024_chunk_032).",
