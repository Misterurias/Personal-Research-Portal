  "answer": "References:\n\n(AIProdDecrease2024, AIProdDecrease2024_chunk_019)\n(AIProdDecrease2024, AIProdDecrease2024_chunk_009)\n(AIProdDecrease2024, AIProdDecrease2024_chunk_026)\n(CopilotCACM2022, CopilotCACM2022_chunk_007)\n(AIProdDecrease2024, AIProdDecrease2024_chunk_031)\n\nHow do findings on productivity gains compare with findings on technical debt and maintenance burden?\n\nThe evidence suggests that the introduction of GitHub Copilot leads to higher development activity at both the repository and individual levels (AIProdDecrease2024, AIProdDecrease2024_chunk_026). This increase in code development activities is accompanied by a significant increase in maintenance-related activities, indicating an accumulation of technical debt (AIProdDecrease2024, AIProdDecrease2024_chunk_019).\n\nFurthermore, the study finds that the increased productivity gains from Copilot-assisted coding are not matched by equivalent improvements in quality, integration with existing code, and maintainability, resulting in a higher maintenance burden for core contributors (AIProdDecrease2024, AIProdDecrease2024_chunk_031). This is evident from the additional workload placed on core contributors, who are expected to review approximately 10 more PRs annually, corresponding to a reduction of 164 commits and 9 PR contributions per year per core contributor (AIProdDecrease2024, AIProdDecrease2024_chunk_026).\n\nIn contrast, the CopilotCACM2022 study suggests that there is no direct correlation between usage metrics and productivity dimensions (CopilotCACM2022, CopilotCACM2022_chunk_007). However, this does not contradict the findings of AIProdDecrease2024, as the two studies focus on different aspects of developer productivity.\n\nIn summary, while productivity gains from GitHub Copilot may be evident, they are accompanied by a higher maintenance burden and an accumulation of technical debt, which may impact the overall efficiency and effectiveness of software development.",
