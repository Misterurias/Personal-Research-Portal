  "answer": "What impact do AI coding assistants have on code quality?\n\nAccording to [EmpiricalToolAnalysis2025_chunk_010], using AI-assisted code generation tools can lead to a 31.4% increase in average developer productivity. However, this increased productivity comes at the cost of introducing 23.7% more security vulnerabilities. The study found that maintainability went up by 18.2%, while cyclomatic complexity decreased by 14.6%.\n\nA similar finding is reported in [EnterpriseImpact2024_chunk_001], which suggests that AI code assistants can lead to a net increase in productivity, but this benefit may not always be experienced by all users.\n\nFurthermore, the study [EmpiricalToolAnalysis2025_chunk_004] highlights the importance of assessing and ensuring the quality of AI-generated code, as it often strays from best design patterns. The authors also raise concerns about security implications, including SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and use of insecure cryptographic methods.\n\nReferences:\n(DevExperienceGenAI2025, DevExperienceGenAI2025_chunk_028)\n(EmpiricalToolAnalysis2025, EmpiricalToolAnalysis2025_chunk_010)\n(EnterpriseImpact2024, EnterpriseImpact2024_chunk_001)\n(EmpiricalToolAnalysis2025, EmpiricalToolAnalysis2025_chunk_004)",
