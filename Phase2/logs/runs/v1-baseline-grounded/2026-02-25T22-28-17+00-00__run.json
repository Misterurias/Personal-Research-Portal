  "answer": "Here is a concise comparison between the enterprise field study (CopilotCACM2022) and the controlled Copilot experiment (DevExperienceGenAI2025):\n\nThe two studies agree on some points. For instance, both studies suggest that developers who use GitHub Copilot experience improvements in task duration and efficiency. In the enterprise field study, participants reported that Copilot helped them stay focused, spend less effort on repetitive tasks, and perform those tasks faster. Similarly, the controlled experiment found that developers using Copilot were significantly faster than those without it.\n\nHowever, the two studies also differ in some ways. The enterprise field study suggests that developers who are more experienced with GitHub Copilot tend to have a better experience, whereas the controlled experiment did not find any significant correlation between experience and productivity. Additionally, the enterprise field study highlights the importance of understanding and debugging generated code, which was not explicitly mentioned in the controlled experiment.\n\nReferences:\n\n(CopilotCACM2022, CopilotCACM2022_chunk_014)\n(DevExperienceGenAI2025, DevExperienceGenAI2025_chunk_013)",
