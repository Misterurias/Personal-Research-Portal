  "answer": "How do AI coding assistants affect junior versus experienced developers differently?\n\nAccording to the evidence, AI-assisted code generation tools can have different impacts on junior and experienced developers. For example, junior developers may benefit more from AI assistance in terms of productivity improvements, but they may also rely too heavily on AI and experience decreased skill formation (SkillFormation2026_chunk_002). On the other hand, experienced developers may be able to use AI tools more independently and effectively, as seen in their higher acceptance rate of AI recommendations compared to junior developers (EmpiricalToolAnalysis2025_chunk_010).\n\nIn terms of learning patterns, novice workers may complete tasks without the same learning outcomes when using AI assistance (Figure 2). This suggests that AI may not necessarily lead to long-term skill development for junior developers.\n\nReferences:\n(SkillFormation2026, SkillFormation2026_chunk_002)\n(EmpiricalToolAnalysis2025, EmpiricalToolAnalysis2025_chunk_010)",
