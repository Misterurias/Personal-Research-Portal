  "answer": "What evidence suggests AI coding assistants reduce productivity in certain contexts?\n\nInsufficient evidence in the current corpus to suggest that AI coding assistants consistently reduce productivity in certain contexts. However, some studies have found that excessive or combined use of AI coding assistant interactions can lead to reduced benefits (DevExperienceGenAI2025, DevExperienceGenAI2025_chunk_019).\n\nOn the other hand, many studies have reported productivity gains from using AI coding assistants. For example, Peng et al. found that crowd-sourced software developers using Copilot completed a task 55.8% faster than the control group (CopilotExperiment2023, CopilotExperiment2023_chunk_001). Similarly, Rodriguez found that the use of Copilot Chat increases programmers' confidence and leads to improvements in code readability, reusability, conciseness, maintainability, and resilience (AIProdDecrease2024, AIProdDecrease2024_chunk_006).\n\nReferences:\n\n* DevExperienceGenAI2025: Brandebusemeyer et al. (2026)\n* CopilotExperiment2023: Ziegler et al. (2024)\n* AIProdDecrease2024: Nagle (2019)\n\nNote: The provided evidence chunks suggest that excessive or combined use of AI coding assistant interactions can lead to reduced benefits, but there is insufficient evidence to conclude that AI coding assistants consistently reduce productivity in certain contexts.",
