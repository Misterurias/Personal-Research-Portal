  "answer": "What evidence suggests AI coding assistants affect developer productivity, and in what direction?\n\nThe provided evidence suggests that AI coding assistants can have a positive impact on developer productivity. Specifically:\n\n* (EnterpriseImpact2024, EnterpriseImpact2024_chunk_001) states that the Watsonx Code Assistant (WCA) increased developers' perceptions of productivity by 31.4%.\n* (CopilotCACM2022, CopilotCACM2022_chunk_001) reports that GitHub Copilot's suggestions have a big impact on developer productivity, with junior developers seeing the largest gains.\n* (SkillFormation2026, SkillFormation2026_chunk_004) notes that AI tools are being used in software development and education, and that many studies have found improvements in productivity using these assistants.\n\nIn terms of direction, the evidence suggests that AI coding assistants can increase developer productivity. However, it is also noted that there may be potential security and maintainability trade-offs associated with using AI-assisted code generation.\n\nReferences:\n(EnterpriseImpact2024, EnterpriseImpact2024_chunk_001)\n(CopilotCACM2022, CopilotCACM2022_chunk_001)\n(SkillFormation2026, SkillFormation2026_chunk_004)",
