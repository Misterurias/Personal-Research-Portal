  "answer": "What evidence suggests AI coding assistants affect developer productivity, and in what direction?\n\nThe evidence suggests that AI coding assistants can positively impact developer productivity. For instance, [EnterpriseImpact2024_chunk_004 | EnterpriseImpact2024] found that developers who used the Watsonx Code Assistant (WCA) reported higher levels of productivity. Similarly, [SkillFormation2026_chunk_004 | SkillFormation2026] found that crowd-sourced software developers using Copilot completed tasks 55.5% faster than the control group.\n\nAnother study [CopilotCACM2022_chunk_001 | CopilotCACM2022] reported that AI pair-programming tools like GitHub Copilot have a big impact on developer productivity, with junior developers seeing the largest gains. The study also found that perceived productivity gains are reflected in objective measurements of developer activity.\n\nReferences:\n\n* [EnterpriseImpact2024_chunk_004 | EnterpriseImpact2024]\n* [SkillFormation2026_chunk_004 | SkillFormation2026]\n* [CopilotCACM2022_chunk_001 | CopilotCACM2022]",
