  "answer": "Is there evidence that AI coding assistants have zero negative side effects?\n\nInsufficient evidence in the current corpus to support the claim that AI coding assistants have zero negative side effects.\n\nWhile some studies suggest that AI coding assistants can improve productivity and reduce the cognitive load of developers (e.g., [Brynjolfsson et al., 2025; Peng et al., 2024]), others raise concerns about the potential risks associated with their use, such as skill depletion (e.g., [Macnamara et al., 2024]) and over-reliance on AI-generated code (e.g., [Lee et al., 2025]). Additionally, there are concerns about the potential impact of AI coding assistants on the long-term sustainability of expertise development amid the proliferation of new AI tools (e.g., [SkillFormation2026, SkillFormation2026_chunk_025]).\n\nReferences:\n\n(Brynjolfsson et al., 2025)\n(Peng et al., 2024)\n(Macnamara et al., 2024)\n(Lee et al., 2025)\n(SkillFormation2026, SkillFormation2026_chunk_025)",
