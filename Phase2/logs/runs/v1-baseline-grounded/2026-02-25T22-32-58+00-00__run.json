The provided chunks do not directly address the impact of AI coding assistants on long-term software maintainability. However, some chunks suggest potential concerns about the quality and maintainability of code generated by AI-assisted tools (EnterpriseImpact2024_chunk_023). Further research is needed to investigate the relationship between AI-generated code and long-term software maintainability.\n\nReferences:\n\n* (EnterpriseImpact2024, EnterpriseImpact2024_chunk_003)\n* (EnterpriseImpact2024, EnterpriseImpact2024_chunk_023)",
