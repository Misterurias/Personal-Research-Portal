  "answer": "How do AI coding tools affect perceived productivity compared to objective performance metrics?\n\nThe findings from this research reveal a complicated trade-off landscape in AI-assisted code generation, which challenges simplistic narrative accounts focused explicitly on productivity (Meyer et al., [34]). The study reveals that developers may be placing too much trust in AI-generated code, using less security judgment in reviewing the AI-generated code compared to their own code, and devolving to a less strict and acute heuristic during their security review (EnterpriseImpact2024, EnterpriseImpact2024_chunk_004).\n\nThe analysis of patterns of aid tool uptake revealed a learning curve. The experimental group reported increasing productivity improvements across tasks: for Task 1, productivity improved by 18.2%; for Task 2, it improved by 28.7%; for Task 3, it improved by 36.4%; and for Task 4, it improved by 41.5% (EmpiricalToolAnalysis2025_chunk_015). These results suggest that AI coding tools can positively impact perceived productivity.\n\nIn terms of objective performance metrics, the study found that GitHub Copilot's code completion funnel showed a significant reduction in completion times, with an average number of events per survey user active hour decreasing by 50% (CopilotCACM2022_chunk_001). This suggests that AI coding tools can also improve objective performance metrics.\n\nIn conclusion, this research provides evidence that AI coding tools can positively impact both perceived productivity and objective performance metrics. The findings suggest that AI-assisted code generation can lead to increased efficiency and effectiveness in software development, but it is essential to consider the potential trade-offs and limitations of relying on AI-generated code.\n\nReferences:\n\n[34] Meyer, J., et al.
