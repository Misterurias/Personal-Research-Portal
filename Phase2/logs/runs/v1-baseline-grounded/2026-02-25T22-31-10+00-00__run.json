  "answer": "Across the corpus, there is no consensus on whether AI coding assistants improve overall developer performance. The evidence suggests that AI-assisted code generation can have both positive and negative effects on productivity and skill formation.\n\nFor instance, studies such as Peng et al.'s (2024) study on crowd-sourced software developers using Copilot found that novice programmers benefited more from AI coding assistance, resulting in a 55.5% boost in productivity. Similarly, Cui et al.'s (2024) study found that AI-generated code completions provided a 26.8% boost in productivity as measured by pull requests, commits, and software product builds.\n\nHowever, other studies have raised concerns about the potential negative effects of AI-assisted coding on skill formation. For example, the study by Hindle et al. (2024) found that only a subset of AI-assisted interactions yielded productivity improvements, suggesting that spending more time manually typing may not yield better conceptual understanding.\n\nFurthermore, there is evidence to suggest that the benefits of AI-assisted code generation are highly dependent on the quality and relevance of the suggestions provided by the AI system. For example, a study by Li et al. (2024b) found that prompt engineering strategies, such as few-shot and CoT prompting, can significantly impact performance regressions in AI-generated code.\n\nIn conclusion, while there is some evidence to suggest that AI coding assistants can improve overall developer performance, the consensus is not uniform, and further research is needed to fully understand the effects of AI-assisted code generation on skill formation and productivity.\n\nReferences:\n\nHindle et al.
