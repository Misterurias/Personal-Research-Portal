  "answer": "Based on the provided evidence, there is some indication that AI assistants may increase technical debt or maintenance burden in open-source software (OSS) projects. Specifically:\n\n* The introduction of GitHub Copilot leads to higher development activity at both the repository and individual levels, but also results in a significant increase in maintenance-related activities, which can be an early indicator of technical debt accumulation (AIProdDecrease2024_chunk_028).\n* AI-assisted contributions from peripheral developers may increase coordination and review burdens for core contributors, who are already reviewing more pull requests (PRs) and contributing fewer commits, resulting in a shift away from writing new code and toward managing code submissions (AIProdDecrease2024_chunk_026).\n\nWhile the evidence suggests that AI assistants can lead to increased productivity gains, it also highlights concerns about the maintenance burden and technical debt accumulation that may arise. However, it is essential to consider the broader context of OSS projects and the dynamics at play.\n\nReferences:\n\n(AIProdDecrease2024, AIProdDecrease2024_chunk_028)\n(AIProdDecrease2024, AIProdDecrease2024_chunk_026)",
