For example, junior developers may benefit more from AI assistance in terms of productivity improvements, but they may also rely too heavily on AI and experience decreased skill formation (SkillFormation2026_chunk_002). On the other hand, experienced developers may be able to use AI tools more independently and effectively, as seen in their higher acceptance rate of AI recommendations compared to junior developers (EmpiricalToolAnalysis2025_chunk_010).\n\nIn terms of learning patterns, novice workers may complete tasks without the same learning outcomes when using AI assistance (Figure 2). This suggests that AI may not necessarily lead to long-term skill development for junior developers.\n\nReferences:\n(SkillFormation2026, SkillFormation2026_chunk_002)\n(EmpiricalToolAnalysis2025, EmpiricalToolAnalysis2025_chunk_010)",

The study found that maintainability went up by 18.2%, while cyclomatic complexity decreased by 14.6%.\n\nA similar finding is reported in [EnterpriseImpact2024_chunk_001], which suggests that AI code assistants can lead to a net increase in productivity, but this benefit may not always be experienced by all users.\n\nFurthermore, the study [EmpiricalToolAnalysis2025_chunk_004] highlights the importance of assessing and ensuring the quality of AI-generated code, as it often strays from best design patterns.

    "answer": "How do AI coding tools affect perceived productivity compared to objective performance metrics?\n\nThe findings from this research reveal a complicated trade-off landscape in AI-assisted code generation, which challenges simplistic narrative accounts focused explicitly on productivity (Meyer et al., [34]). The study reveals that developers may be placing too much trust in AI-generated code, using less security judgment in reviewing the AI-generated code compared to their own code, and devolving to a less strict and acute heuristic during their security review (EnterpriseImpact2024, EnterpriseImpact2024_chunk_004).\n\nThe analysis of patterns of aid tool uptake revealed a learning curve. The experimental group reported increasing productivity improvements across tasks: for Task 1, productivity improved by 18.2%; for Task 2, it improved by 28.7%; for Task 3, it improved by 36.4%; and for Task 4, it improved by 41.5% (EmpiricalToolAnalysis2025_chunk_015). These results suggest that AI coding tools can positively impact perceived productivity.\n\nIn terms of objective performance metrics, the study found that GitHub Copilot's code completion funnel showed a significant reduction in completion times, with an average number of events per survey user active hour decreasing by 50% (CopilotCACM2022_chunk_001). This suggests that AI coding tools can also improve objective performance metrics.\n\nIn conclusion, this research provides evidence that AI coding tools can positively impact both perceived productivity and objective performance metrics. The findings suggest that AI-assisted code generation can lead to increased efficiency and effectiveness in software development, but it is essential to consider the potential trade-offs and limitations of relying on AI-generated code.\n\nReferences:\n\n[34] Meyer, J., et al.

This gain is driven by a 2.1% increase in individual code contributions and a 3.4% rise in developer coding participation. However, these benefits come at a cost as coordination time for code integration increases by 8% due to more code discussions enabled by AI pair programmers (OpenSourceImpact2024_chunk_001).\n\nThe study also finds that the effects of AI pair programmers differ across developer roles. Peripheral developers show relatively smaller gains in project-level code contributions and face a higher increase in coordination time than core developers, likely due to their difference in project familiarity (OpenSourceImpact2024_chunk_032).",

For instance, both studies suggest that developers who use GitHub Copilot experience improvements in task duration and efficiency. In the enterprise field study, participants reported that Copilot helped them stay focused, spend less effort on repetitive tasks, and perform those tasks faster. Similarly, the controlled experiment found that developers using Copilot were significantly faster than those without it.\n\nHowever, the two studies also differ in some ways. The enterprise field study suggests that developers who are more experienced with GitHub Copilot tend to have a better experience, whereas the controlled experiment did not find any significant correlation between experience and productivity. Additionally, the enterprise field study highlights the importance of understanding and debugging generated code, which was not explicitly mentioned in the controlled experiment.\n\nReferences:\n\n(CopilotCACM2022, CopilotCACM2022_chunk_014)\n(DevExperienceGenAI2025, DevExperienceGenAI2025_chunk_013)",

This increase in code development activities is accompanied by a significant increase in maintenance-related activities, indicating an accumulation of technical debt (AIProdDecrease2024, AIProdDecrease2024_chunk_019).\n\nFurthermore, the study finds that the increased productivity gains from Copilot-assisted coding are not matched by equivalent improvements in quality, integration with existing code, and maintainability, resulting in a higher maintenance burden for core contributors (AIProdDecrease2024, AIProdDecrease2024_chunk_031). This is evident from the additional workload placed on core contributors, who are expected to review approximately 10 more PRs annually, corresponding to a reduction of 164 commits and 9 PR contributions per year per core contributor (AIProdDecrease2024, AIProdDecrease2024_chunk_026).\n\nIn contrast, the CopilotCACM2022 study suggests that there is no direct correlation between usage metrics and productivity dimensions (CopilotCACM2022, CopilotCACM2022_chunk_007). However, this does not contradict the findings of AIProdDecrease2024, as the two studies focus on different aspects of developer productivity.\n\nIn summary, while productivity gains from GitHub Copilot may be evident, they are accompanied by a higher maintenance burden and an accumulation of technical debt, which may impact the overall efficiency and effectiveness of software development.",
