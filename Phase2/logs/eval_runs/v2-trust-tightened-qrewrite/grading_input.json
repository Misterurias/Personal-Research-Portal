    "answer": "How do AI coding tools affect perceived productivity compared to objective performance metrics?\n\nThe study by Ziegler et al.

This is consistent with the findings from another study that examined the impact of AI-assisted code generation on developer productivity [EmpiricalToolAnalysis2025_chunk_010 | EmpiricalToolAnalysis2025]. The study found a significant increase in productivity when using AI-generated code, which suggests that AI coding tools can positively impact perceived productivity.\n\nIn terms of objective performance metrics, the study by Kalliamvakou et al.

Additionally, there is a concern about issues of misunderstanding in cloning obfuscated code in libraries; licensing problems in open-source projects; and the potential for unnoticed subtle logical problems in open-source projects (Perry et al., EmpiricalToolAnalysis2025_chunk_001). Furthermore, the research found that AI-assisted code generation tools may lead to poor quality and insecure software development if not properly implemented (EmpiricalToolAnalysis2025, EmpiricalToolAnalysis2025_chunk_003).\n\nThe use of AI-assisted code generation tools was found to introduce 23.7% more security vulnerabilities in the generated codes (EmpiricalToolAnalysis2025).

Both studies suggest that using Copilot can improve developer productivity, with 19 out of 24 participants expressing a strong preference for using Copilot for day-to-day programming tasks.\n\nHowever, the two studies also have some key differences. The field study found that while individual interaction with either in-code suggestions or chat prompts improves efficiency, combining interaction types does not yield additional time savings compared to not using Copilot. In contrast, the controlled experiment did not find any significant difference in task completion time between the AI and non-AI conditions.\n\nAnother important difference is the way participants used Copilot in each study. The field study found that some participants used Copilot as a replacement for internet search, while others used it to generate fully formed functions that completed tasks they were unsure how to approach. In contrast, the controlled experiment did not report any specific patterns of user interaction with Copilot.\n\nIn conclusion, while both studies suggest that using Copilot can improve developer productivity, they also highlight some important differences in the way participants use Copilot and the benefits it provides.\n\nReferences:\n\n* DevExperienceGenAI2025: \"Assessing the Usability of GitHub Copilot: A User Study\"\n* DevExperienceGenAI2025_chunk_013: \"The Effects of Prompt Engineering on Code Generation\"\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Warning: Reference consistency issue: References: section is empty.",
